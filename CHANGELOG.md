# Change Log

## 0.6

* Display links to related pages when included in annotation metadata; only show related pages section
   when an annotation has related pages.
* Remove starter blog posts and document available blog functionality in README.md
* bugfix: update annotation-by-tag template so it displays all tagged annotations, not just the first

## 0.5 - Initial release

Developed with [readux](http://github.com/emory-libraries/readux) 1.4 and [teifacsimile-to-jekyll](https://github.com/emory-libraries-ecds/teifacsimile-to-jekyll) 0.65.

Jekyll theme adapted from Lanyon customized to support displaying an annotated
facsimile edition as generated by Readux and teifacsimile-to-jekyll, including
volume pages, annotations, and tags.
- volume page layout displays page image with text overlay (HTML generated by teifacsimile-to-jekyll,
   styles adapted from Readux)
- annotations displayed in the margin of volume pages, adapted from Readux display and
    [annotator-marginalia](https://github.com/emory-lits-labs/annotator-marginalia)
- browse pages by thumbnail, with all images on one page, loaded as needed for display
- page thumbnails include annotation count indicator (adapted from Readux)
- annotations display tags;  browse annotations by tag
- simple keyword searching on volume pages and annotation content, based on
  [Simple-Jekyll-Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search)
- supports customization for volume page urls and labels
- site homepage includes embedded citation information for harvest by
   [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and similar tools, based on annotated
   edition data from the site config file
- social media metadata to provide previews when sharing on Twitter,
  Facebook, Google+, and the like
- site homepage provides link to annotated edition TEI if linked in site config file
- individual annotation pages, linked from marginalia view, to provide better
  access to long-form or multimedia annotation and for citability
- tablet/mobile friendly design:
    - sidebar configuration now defaults to overlay instead of push
    - touch swipe to navigate next/previous volume pages
    - on smaller screens, annotations fall below the page image
    - when annotations are displayed below the page image,  an annotation
      count with jump link is displayed at the top of the page
    - use HTML5 picture element to display smaller page thumbnail images
      for smaller screens on page browse
