## Course description

As science becomes increasingly more data and computation intensive, maintaining
the ability to build on our own or other’s prior work requires that the process
that takes data and other inputs all the way to the results presented in a paper
is documented and made available in full detail.

This course will teach participants how to develop workflows going from raw data
to graphics and statistical analysis, using the programming language and
statistical environment R. Over the course of the semester, participants will
learn the skills to write scripts to automate data formatting and analysis,
making their studies replicable.

## Course Goals

* Understanding and being able to use basic programming concepts
* Automate data analysis
* Working collaboratively and openly on code
* Knowing how to generate dynamic documents
* Being able to use a continuous test-driven development approach

## Course format

### Lectures

There will be three 3-hour long lectures on January 16th, Februrary 13th, March
  13th. The other weeks, the lab will be open and the instructor will be present
  to help working towards the final project and the package presentation.

### Package demonstrations

Towards the end of the semester, each week, a group will present a package of
  their choice to the rest of the class. This presentation will include a
  general overview of the package as well as an hands-on part where everyone in
  the class will have the opportunity to use the package. A draft of the handout
  and exercises will need to be posted on Github at least 1 week before
  presentation so that feedback can be provided.

### Final project

It's easier to learn programming by doing. Because many of the concepts covered
  in the class will be new, they will require a significant time commitment to
  embrace them. Recognizing that time in graduate school is precious, and that
  the skills taught in this class should be directly applicable, students will
  work in groups to design a project that will improve, facilitate their current
  or future research. Working on the project will take most of our classroom
  time (and will also take time outside of class, actually it has been
  recommended that students should program at least every other day when learning).

## Schedule

This schedule is tentative. Topics and coverage may change. Other topics will be
covered in short lectures depending on the interests of the class and needs for
the final projects (potential topics include: data manipulation, working with
dates, regular expressions, etc.)

## Code of conduct

No harassment of participants in any form will be tolerated. Harassment includes
offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put
down other attendees.  Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the classroom at the sole
discretion. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other
exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the
instructor may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
offender or expulsion from the classroom.

## Accommodations for Students With Disabilities

Students who will require a classroom accommodation for a disability must
contact the Dean of Students Office of Disability Resources, in Peabody 202
(phone: 352 -­‐ 392 -­‐ 1261).  Please see the U niversity of Florida Disability
Resources website for more information at: http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/ .  Note
that the student should provide documentation of a requirement for accommodation
by the second week of classes .  No accommodations are available to students who
lack this documentation , and accommodations are not retroactive .  It is the
policy of the University of Florida that the student, not the instructor, is
responsible for arranging accommodations when needed.  Once notification is
complete, the Dean of Students Office of Disability Resources will work with the
instructor to accommodate t


## UF Counseling Services
