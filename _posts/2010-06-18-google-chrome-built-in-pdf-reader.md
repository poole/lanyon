title: Google Chrome PDF reader

> With this effort, we will accomplish the following:

> * PDF files will render as seamlessly as HTML web pages, and basic interactions will be no different than the same interactions with web pages (for example, zooming and searching will work as users expect). PDF rendering quality is still a work in progress, and we will improve it substantially before releasing it to the beta and stable channels.
> * To further protect users, PDF functionality will be contained within the security [sandbox](href="http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/) Chrome uses for web page rendering.
> * Users will automatically receive the latest version of Chrome’s PDF support; they won’t have to worry about manually updating any plug-ins or programs.

The latest dev release of Google’s Chrome browser contains a built-in PDF reader. The plug-in can be enabled by going to **chrome://plugins/** and clicking on **"Enable"** for the **"Chrome PDF Viewer"** plug-in.
