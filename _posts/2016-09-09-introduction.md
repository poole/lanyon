### The start of something new

I've just spent the last four days in Aberystwyth, Wales at [iOS Dev UK][1].
Something I've done two years in a row now and I've loved every minute of it.

Back in 2015 on the 4 hour train journey back to Bristol I told myself that I wanted to start getting involved with the community more. The idea was that I would start a blog to share things I learn as I go about my day to day job as an iOS Developer.  

Fast forward a year and I find myself on the exact same journey home with the exact same feeling I had last year. This time I'm forcing myself to do something about it so here I am starting a blog. I'm pretty new to all of this so you'll probably find that it's going to be a bit crap to start with but hey, we've all got to start somewhere right? Feedback is welcome!

So anyway. I've got a day off work today and I'm about to embark on another 3 hour train journey to visit some family over the weekend so now is the perfect time to get an actual development related blog post up right? Wish me luck.

### About Me

My name is Liam Nichols, I'm currently a Senior iOS Developer at Rockpool Digital in Bristol.
I also twitter as [@liamnichols_][2] on the Internet from time to time.  

After finding [this book][3] in my local Library back sometime around 2011, I found myself bodging apps together when I wasn't busy stacking shelves at Asda.
By doing this, I was able to work my way into a *real* job as an iOS Developer across the country in Bristol and with the support of some great people, I'm still here over 3 and a half years later and loving every minute of it.  

That should probably do it for now but if for some reason you want to find out more then feel free to [tweet me][2] or email me at [liam.nichols.ln@gmail.com][4].
